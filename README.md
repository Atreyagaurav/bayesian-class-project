# Missing Variable Inference using Bayesian Approach on a River Network

A Directed Tree Graph is being used to find ways to infer the missing
data in the nodes based on the adjancent nodes.

More details to be added later.

## How to Run
The JAGS models are in `jags` directory. `R` code is in `jags-multi.r`
file, which is intended to be run interactively for each type of model
by changing the `model` variable to `"basic"`, `"linear"`, `"output"`
and `"inputs"`.
